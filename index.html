            <h1>How to play Poker:</h1>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>You and your opponent both recieve two random cards at the beginning of the game</li>
                <li>Then another card is place faced up in the middle of the playing table</li>
                <li>The certain combinations of cards which can be made with the two cards you recieved, and the card(s) on the playing table determine which "hand" you have (see poker hands below). Some hands are valued higher than others.</li>
                <li>You are then able to bet money on who has the higher hand, then the opponent bets and then you again</li>
                <li>After betting is done, an additional card is placed in the middle of the table</li>
                <li>This process is repeated until there are five cards on the playing table</li>
                <li>Once all five cards are uncovered on the playing table, the player with the higher hand wins all the bets made in the game.</li>
            </ol>
            <br>
            <h1>Poker hands in ascending order, your hand is always the highest combination which is possible with your cards:</h1>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>High card - the highest card, this only applies if you have no other combinations</li>
                <li>Pair - two cards of the same rank</li>
                <li>Two pair - two pairs</li>
                <li>Three of a kind - three cards with the same rank</li>
                <li>Straight - five cards where the ranks increase by 1 each (not included in this version of the game)</li>
                <li>Flush - five cards of the same suit</li>
                <li>Full house - a pair and a three of a kind</li>
                <li>Four of a kind - four cards with the same rank</li>
                <li>Straight flush - five cards of the same suit where the ranks increase by 1 each (not included in this version of the game)</li>
                <li>Royal flush - a 10, Jack, Queen, King and Ace all of the same suit</li>
            </ol>
